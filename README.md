## Gatsby Plugins

gatsby-image

- Had a few issues with graphql, saying images were null.
  Solution was to reset gatsby cache by: [this link helped](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/9917)

```
gatsby clean
gatsby build
gatsby develop
```

## Packages Used

For the enlargement of images when clicked I used a modal.
